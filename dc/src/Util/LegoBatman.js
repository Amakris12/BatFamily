        story:"The game features two distinct campaigns: a hero storyline, where Batman and Robin fight the villains one by one while attempting to thwart their schemes; and a villain storyline, where the player assumes the role of the villains as they attempt to carry out their plan while avoiding the GCPD. Both campaigns consist of three individual chapters (one for each villain group), which can be played in any order. The hero levels often cross over with the villain levels to create a sense of continuity. To understand the complete story of a chapter, one must play both the hero and villain levels (for example, Bane is never encountered during the hero portion of the Penguin's chapter because he had already been captured by the GCPD in a villain level).",
